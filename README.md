The activity was to replay the example mjhea0/flaskr-tdd.

## What are pros and cons of TDD?

Pros:
- Helps you learn and understand good modular design
- Makes code easier to maintain and refractor by catching errors early
- Makes collaboration on code easier because tests will inform if edits are making the code behave differently
- Helps programmers fully understand their code
- Tests are written before code so programmer doesn't have to go back and write tests at the end

Cons:
- Goals may not be determined yet at the start of writing code
- It slows down implementation initially because it takes longer to start project as tests are being written at the same time
- The tests may not cover all corner cases
- Every person on a team has to correctly maintain their tests or the whole system suffers
